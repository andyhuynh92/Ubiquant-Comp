# Ubiquant-Comp

These are the Jupyter notebooks I used for the [Ubiquant market prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ubiquant-market-prediction/) competition on Kaggle.

1. `Finding the distribution of the target.ipynb`
    Here, I was trying to find the distribution of the target column with the `time_id` fixed. I found out that the target follows a $t$-distribution, and not a normal distribution.

2. Getting stock data.ipynb
   Using the reverse engineered data, I grabbed the stock closing price using the Yahoo finance API.
